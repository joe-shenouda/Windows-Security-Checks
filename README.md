# Windows-Security-Checks

This PowerShell script performs security checks on a Windows system, checking for Windows Defender status, firewall status, user account control (UAC) settings, automatic updates, BitLocker status, guest account status, network sharing, PowerShell execution policy, Secure Boot, SMBv1, RDP, Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS), and audit policy. The script generates a report with the results and outputs it to a text file. This tool can be used to quickly check the security posture of a Windows system and identify any potential issues that need to be addressed. Use at your own risk.
